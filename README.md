**Empowering Independence Through AI-Powered Visual Assistance**

</div>

## 🏆 Project Overview

Vision Assist is an innovative mobile application that leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to provide real-time environmental awareness and navigation assistance for visually impaired individuals. By combining Google Mediapipe object detection, Google Maps navigation, and Gemini AI's natural language capabilities, we've created a comprehensive solution that enhances independence and safety.

### Key Features

- 🎯 **Real-time Object Detection**
- 🗺️ **Intelligent Navigation**: outdoor navigation
- 🔊 **Natural Language Feedback**: Context-aware audio descriptions

## 🎯 Problem Statement

285 million people worldwide face significant challenges in navigating their environment independently. Traditional assistive technologies provide limited information, while existing high-tech solutions are often:

- Prohibitively expensive
- Complex to use
- Limited in functionality
- Privacy-invasive
- Connectivity-dependent

Vision Assist addresses these challenges by transforming standard smartphones into powerful assistive devices.
